# What is Hacktoberfest?

Every October, Digital Ocean runs Hacktoberfest, a month-long celebration of open-sourced software. Encouraging developers at all stages in their careers to participate in the open-source community. The event is open to everyone in the global community, no matter your skill level or background and it grows in size every year.

Hacktoberfest 2023 returns to ZTM with three brand new projects for you to complete the challenge and earn your [digital reward]

This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will have a tree planted in their name!

You can find out more details about Hacktoberfest on their website, as well as track your progress throughout the month.
